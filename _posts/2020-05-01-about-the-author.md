Reed Terrell is a software engineer / full stack web developer living in Longmont Colorado. He studied Music Performance at CU Boulder for a time before realizing
that the actual career opportunities weren't so great for that being that he was already burned out after a year.

He then studied Boichemsitry before then realizing that he didn't really want to get a PhD and work in a lab his whole life. Then through the magic of the internet, Reed met a bunch of programming
nerds playing a video game called Eve: Online. Before he knew it he was fully inducted into the cult of Javascript and became a web developer. And people say
video games don't teach you anything.

Reed's main programming languages are Python and Javascript, with previous experience with C#, and some tinkering with Rust and C++. He has been actively programming
since 2016, and working full time as a developer since January of 2018. When he's not brawling with CSS rules he skis, mountain bikes, runs, and rock climbs.
He also still plays too many video games.
