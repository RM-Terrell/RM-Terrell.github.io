Well I started a new job!

After many years of service at ArcherDX / Invitae I have taken an MTS Software Engineer position at NetApp working with Go, Kubernetes, Python, and Docker. I learned an absurd amount at Archer and am very grateful for my time there, but with my recent interests in working with lower level static languages, along with Docker and its related technologies, NetApp struck me as the perfect place to continue to grow.

This blog will see some content changes because of this, as I am putting my learning of Rust on hold for a bit to focus on Go and K8s, so get ready for misadventures in cloud application engineering!
