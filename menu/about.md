I am a full stack web developer living in Longmont Colorado, where I have been working for 3 years at ArcherDX Inc (now part of Invitae) building web based genomic diagnostics tools using Python, Django, PSQL, Javascript, and React. In my time there I have contributed to projects both for pure research use and also regulated medical device products. My most recent work has involved integrated React and Jest into existing legacy products and also build out REST API endpoints in Django that are consumed by React.

My distractions from work include skiing, running, PC gaming, and mountain biking.
