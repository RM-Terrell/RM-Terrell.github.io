I am a full stack web developer living in Longmont Colorado, where I have been working at ArcherDX Inc (now Invitae Oncology) since January 2018 building web based genomic diagnostics tools using Python, Django, PSQL, Javascript, and React. In my time there I have contributed to projects both for pure research use and also regulated medical device products. My most recent work has involved integrating React, Jest, Webpack, and Babel into existing legacy products and also building out REST API endpoints in Django that are consumed by React.

I have a passion for well tested and documented code with experience in Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, Pytest, Nose2, and Selenium, and am currently learning Rust on the side.

My distractions from work include skiing, running, PC gaming, and mountain biking.
