I am a software engineer living in Erie Colorado, where I am currently employed at Yes Energy working as a React, Python, and Java application engineer. I have previous experience using Go, Python, Javascript, React, PSQL, Kubernetes, Docker, MongoDB, and other technologies building data intensive applications for a wide range of industries including medical and cloud application data management.

I have a passion for well tested and documented code with experience in Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, Pytest, Nose2, Golang test runner, and Selenium.

My distractions from work include mountain biking, skiing, and PC gaming. I'm also actively trying to be a less terrible cook.
