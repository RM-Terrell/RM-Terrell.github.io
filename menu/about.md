I am a software engineer living in Longmont Colorado, where I am currently working at NetApp utilizing Go, Kubernetes, Docker, and Python to build cloud data management applications. Previously I worked at ArcherDX (now Invitae Oncology) building web based genomic diagnostics tools using Python, Django, PSQL, Javascript, and React. I have contributed to Kubernetes powered data management applications, along with projects at ArcherDX both for pure research (RUO) and also regulated medical device products (IVD).

I have a passion for well tested and documented code with experience in Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, Pytest, Nose2, Golang test runner, Selenium, Jira, and Confluence.

My distractions from work include mountain biking, skiing, and PC gaming. I'm also actively trying to be a less terrible cook.
